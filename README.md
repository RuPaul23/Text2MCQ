## Introduction

The "text2mcq" repository contains three text generation models for various purposes: normal subjective text generation, question subjective text generation, and objective text generation. 
These models can be used to generate text for a variety of applications such as natural language generation, text augmentation, and more.

# Create a virtual environment (venv) to isolate the project dependencies:
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment:
# On macOS and Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate

# Install the required libraries using pip:
pip install rake_nltk, and other necessary library

```

## Usage
